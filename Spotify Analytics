--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--I then created a table to insert Spotify data into and performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data using the following SQL: 

--Who are the Top 10 artists based on average danceability? 
SELECT 
    artist_name, 
    AVG(danceability) 
FROM Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC
LIMIT 10; 

--Which song ranks the least in speechiness, and which aritst is it by? 
SELECT 
    track_name, 
    artist_name,
    speechiness 
FROM Spotifydata 
ORDER BY speechiness
LIMIT 1; 

--Which song by Doja Cat ranks the highest in energy?
SELECT 
    track_name,
    energy
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 1;
